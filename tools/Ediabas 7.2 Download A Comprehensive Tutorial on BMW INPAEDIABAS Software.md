- "OBD.INI": This file contains the settings for OBD communication protocol, such as the protocol type, the pin number, etc.
- "C:\Windows\OBD.INI": This file is a copy of the previous file that needs to be placed in the Windows folder for some applications to work properly.

The exact values that you need to enter in these files depend on your cable or interface type and your vehicle model.
