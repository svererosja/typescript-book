Here are some tips and tricks to help you get started with Civilization VI: Digital Deluxe:

1. Choose a leader that suits your playstyle and victory goal. Each leader has a unique ability, a unique unit, and a unique infrastructure that give them an edge in certain aspects of the game. For example, if you want to pursue a cultural victory, you might want to play as France, which gets bonuses for building wonders and spies. If you want to pursue a domination victory, you might want to play as Scythia, which gets bonuses for cavalry units and healing after combat.
2. Plan your city placement carefully. Cities are the backbone of your civilization, and where you place them can have a huge impact on your game. You want to settle near resources, rivers, coasts, mountains, and natural wonders that can provide you with food, production, gold, science, culture, faith, and amenities. You also want to consider the terrain and the adjacency bonuses of your districts and wonders. For example, campuses get bonuses from mountains and rainforests, while holy sites get bonuses from mountains and natural wonders.
3. Balance your research and culture. Research and culture are the two main ways to unlock new technologies and civics in the game. Technologies allow you to build new units, buildings, districts, and wonders, while civics allow you to adopt new policies, governments, and envoys. You want to balance your research and culture output so that you can access the most useful and relevant options for your strategy. You can also boost your research and culture by completing certain tasks in the game, such as building a quarry or meeting another civilization.
4. Manage your relationships with other civilizations and city-states. Diplomacy is a key aspect of Civilization VI, as it can affect your trade, war, alliances, and influence. You can interact with other civilizations through trade deals, declarations of friendship or war, agendas, grievances, emergencies, and resolutions. You can also interact with city-states through envoys, quests, suzerainty, and loyalty. You want to maintain good relations with civilizations and city-states that share your interests and goals, while avoiding or confronting those that oppose or threaten you.
5. Adapt to the changing world. Civilization VI is a game that evolves over time, as new events and challenges arise. You have to deal with natural disasters, climate change, barbarians, rebellions, spies, grievances, emergencies, resolutions, and more. You have to be flexible and adaptable to the changing world, as you might have to adjust your strategy or priorities accordingly. You also have to be prepared for the endgame scenarios, such as the World Congress votes or the Exoplanet Expedition.

Civilization VI: Digital Deluxe is a game that will test your skills as a leader and a strategist. It is a game that will immerse you in the history and culture of different civilizations. It is a game that will challenge you to create your own legacy in the world. It is a game that will make you say "one more turn" over and over again.
