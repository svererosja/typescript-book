Zimmer NexGen is a complete knee solution that offers a range of implants and options for total knee arthroplasty. It is one of the most widely used and clinically proven total knee systems in the world, with over 5 million implantations and 300 publications. In this article, we will provide a brief overview of the Zimmer NexGen sizing chart and how it can help surgeons and patients choose the best component combination for any given case.
 
## What is Zimmer NexGen?
 
Zimmer NexGen is a comprehensive portfolio of knee implants that are designed to accommodate different patient needs, preferences, and anatomies. The system features four main types of implants:

- NexGen CR-Flex Fixed Bearing Knee: Designed to help maintain adequate tibio-femoral contact during high flexion
- NexGen Gender Solutions High-Flex Implants: Designed to accommodate the differences between womenâs and menâs knees
- NexGen Legacy LPS-Flex Knee: Designed to enable high-flexion activities
- NexGen Trabecular Metal Tibia: Features Monoblock and Modular tibial options for cementless application

Each implant type has different sizes and specifications that can be matched to the patientâs anatomy and desired outcome. The Zimmer NexGen sizing chart is a tool that helps surgeons select the appropriate implant size and alignment based on preoperative measurements and intraoperative adjustments.
 
## How to use Zimmer NexGen Sizing Chart?
 
The Zimmer NexGen sizing chart consists of two parts: a femoral sizing chart and a tibial sizing chart. The femoral sizing chart shows the dimensions of the femoral components in millimeters, including the anterior-posterior (AP) length, medial-lateral (ML) width, distal thickness, anterior flange thickness, posterior condylar offset, and box height. The tibial sizing chart shows the dimensions of the tibial baseplates and articular surfaces in millimeters, including the AP length, ML width, thickness, stem length, stem diameter, and keel depth.
 
To use the Zimmer NexGen sizing chart, surgeons need to follow these steps:

1. Obtain preoperative radiographs of the patientâs knee in AP and lateral views
2. Measure the AP length and ML width of the femur and tibia using calipers or templates
3. Compare the measurements with the Zimmer NexGen sizing chart and select the closest matching size for each component
4. During surgery, use trial components to verify the fit and alignment of the implants
5. Make any necessary adjustments to achieve optimal stability, range of motion, and ligament balance
6. Implant the final components using cemented or cementless fixation techniques

## What are the benefits of Zimmer NexGen Sizing Chart?
 
The Zimmer NexGen sizing chart is a useful tool that can help surgeons and patients achieve better outcomes from knee replacement surgery. Some of the benefits of using the Zimmer NexGen sizing chart are:

- It allows for more accurate implant selection based on patient-specific anatomy and biomechanics
- It reduces the risk of implant overhang, underhang, malrotation, or mismatch that can cause instability, pain, or wear
- It enhances implant performance and longevity by optimizing contact area, load distribution, and stress transfer
- It improves patient satisfaction and quality of life by restoring function, mobility, and comfort

## Conclusion
 
Zimmer NexGen is a complete knee solution that offers a variety of implants and options for total knee arthroplasty. The Zimmer NexGen sizing chart is a helpful guide that can assist surgeons and patients in choosing the best implant size and alignment for each case. By using the Zimmer NexGen sizing chart, surgeons can achieve more precise implant fit and alignment, which can lead to better implant performance, durability, and patient outcomes.
