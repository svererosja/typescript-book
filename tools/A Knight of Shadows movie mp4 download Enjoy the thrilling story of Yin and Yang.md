The movie received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, who praised the visual effects and the cast's performances, but criticized the plot and the editing. The movie has a 4.9/10 rating on IMDb based on 1.7K user ratings[^1^]. Some reviewers enjoyed the movie's humor, fantasy and romance elements, while others found it confusing, chaotic and childish. One reviewer wrote: \"This is an asian high-fantasy movie rather than a martial arts flick. So adrenaline junkies looking to get their fix on this are going to be disappointed. This does have a relatively good premise and story. The characters are well-thought out and enjoyable. Unfortunately the English text translation is so extremely bad it is sometimes difficult to follow the story.\"[^1^]
 
The movie was also compared to other movies based on Pu Songling's stories, such as Painted Skin and Legend of the Demon Cat. Some reviewers felt that The Knight of Shadows was inferior to those movies in terms of storytelling and atmosphere. One reviewer wrote: \"The Knight Of Shadows is a big, colourful, character filled fantasy that plays like a tamer version of Takeshi Miike's Great Yokai War but with a much lighter tone. There is some wire-fu and swordplay action of course, but for the most of it Jackie flies around writing spells with his magic brush and scaring kids.\"[^3^]

The movie was also nominated for several awards, including Best Action Choreography and Best Visual Effects at the 38th Hong Kong Film Awards, and Best Action Design at the 13th Asian Film Awards. However, it did not win any of them. The movie also received a limited theatrical release in the United States on January 5, 2020, by Well Go USA Entertainment. The movie was later released on digital, Blu-ray and DVD on March 10, 2020. [^2^]
 
The Knight of Shadows is a movie that appeals to fans of Jackie Chan and Chinese fantasy genre. It is not a typical martial arts movie, but rather a whimsical and colorful adventure that showcases Chan's charm and charisma. The movie also pays tribute to the classic stories of Pu Songling, who is widely regarded as the master of Chinese supernatural fiction. The movie may not be a masterpiece, but it is a fun and entertaining ride that offers some laughs, thrills and romance.
