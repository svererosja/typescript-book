## Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance - How to Play and Enjoy the Game
 
Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is a game that requires both strategy and skill to master. The game has a variety of modes and options that allow players to customize their experience and challenge themselves. Here are some tips and tricks on how to play and enjoy the game.
 
- The game has four difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Maniac. The difficulty affects the number and strength of enemies, as well as the availability of items and gold. Easy mode is recommended for beginners, while Maniac mode is only for experts who want a brutal challenge.
- The game has two modes of play: Classic and Casual. In Classic mode, units that die in battle are permanently gone, while in Casual mode, they are revived after each chapter. Classic mode adds more tension and consequences to the game, while Casual mode allows players to experiment and have fun without worrying about losing their favorite units.
- The game has a base camp feature that lets players manage their units between chapters. In the base camp, players can buy and sell items, equip skills, forge weapons, view supports, train units, and access bonus content. The base camp is a great way to prepare for the next battle and learn more about the characters and the world.
- The game has a support system that allows units to form bonds with each other. By having units fight near each other or talk to each other in the base camp, they can increase their support level and gain stat bonuses and special conversations. The support system adds more depth and personality to the units and their relationships.
- The game has a shape-shifting feature that lets some units transform into animals, such as dragons, lions, hawks, or cats. These units have different stats and abilities in their animal form, and can switch between forms at will. However, they also have a gauge that depletes over time or when they take damage. When the gauge runs out, they revert to their human form and become vulnerable. The shape-shifting feature adds more variety and strategy to the gameplay.
