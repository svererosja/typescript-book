## How to Crack VirtualDJ Software
 
VirtualDJ is a popular DJ software that lets you mix songs, videos, and other media on your computer. It has many features and effects that can enhance your performance and creativity. However, it also requires a license to use all the functions and access all the content. A license for VirtualDJ Pro Infinity costs $299 and a subscription for VirtualDJ Pro costs $19 per month.
 
If you don't want to pay for a license, you might be tempted to crack VirtualDJ software and use it for free. Cracking is a process of modifying the software to bypass the security measures and remove the limitations. There are many websites and forums that offer cracked versions of VirtualDJ or tools to crack it yourself.
 
However, cracking VirtualDJ software is not a good idea. Here are some reasons why you should avoid it:

- It is illegal. Cracking software is a form of piracy and violates the terms of service and the copyright laws. You could face legal consequences if you get caught.
- It is risky. Cracked software often contains malware, viruses, or spyware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. You could lose your data, compromise your security, or damage your system.
- It is unreliable. Cracked software often has bugs, errors, or glitches that can affect its performance and functionality. You could experience crashes, freezes, or corrupted files. You could also miss out on updates, fixes, or new features that the official version offers.
- It is unethical. Cracking software is unfair to the developers who work hard to create and maintain the software. You are depriving them of their rightful income and recognition. You are also disrespecting the DJ community who supports the software and its development.

Therefore, if you want to use VirtualDJ software, you should buy a license or use the free version that has some limitations but still allows you to mix with two decks. You can also try other free or cheaper alternatives that have similar features and functions.

To use VirtualDJ Remote for iOS, you need to have VirtualDJ installed on your computer and connect it to the same Wi-Fi network as your iOS device. You also need to purchase and download the app from the App Store. The app costs $9.99 and requires iOS 9.0 or later.

4. Select your computer from the list of available devices and enter the password from step 2.
