## Mumbai Saga Movie Review: A Mixed Bag of Action and Drama
 
The critics and the audiences have given a mixed response to Mumbai Saga, which released on March 19, 2021. While some praised the film for its direction, cinematography, music and acting, others found it predictable, cliched and over-the-top.
 
One of the common complaints about the film was that it did not offer anything new or original to the genre of gangster films. The film was compared to Sanjay Gupta's previous films like Shootout at Lokhandwala and Shootout at Wadala, which also dealt with similar themes and characters. Some critics also felt that the film did not capture the essence and the spirit of Mumbai in the 80s and 90s.
